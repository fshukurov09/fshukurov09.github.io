            <h2>Beyond Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of my studies and tech pursuits, I practice judo. The discipline, focus, and continuous improvement mindset from martial arts 
                complement my approach to learning technology. Both require dedication, respect for fundamentals, and the humility to learn from every experience.

            <h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a self-learner at heart, constantly exploring new concepts and technologies beyond the classroom. I believe in hands-on learning—
                building projects, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding the 'why' behind every technology. My goal is to bridge theoretical 
                knowledge with practical application, creating solutions that make a real impact.
